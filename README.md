# RBM_PB
Solving Parameterized PB Equation by Reduced Basis Method\\
These codes are used in my research project 2.\\
Codes named as "one dimensional case" is for one dimensional PBE. Other is for two dimensinal PBE. \\
Runcode.m is the main code either in one dimensional case or two.


# RBM = offline+online
 Offline: select RB basis\\
 Online:calculate a specific solution or perform our error test
 
# differential capacitance file
To calculate differential capacitance of different D and V
